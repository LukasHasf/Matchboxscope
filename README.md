## ESP32 code



### How to install 

In order to get the code compiled and uploaded to your ESP32 camera board, a number of steps have to be carried out to prepare the system. 

#### Compile and Upload 

This code is written for the `AI_THINKER`

1. Download the Arduino IDE 1.8.X from [here](https://arduino.cc/)
2. Install the ESP32 IDF tool through the arduino board manager; Add the following link to the settings (a more in-depth tutorial can be found [here](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/installing-the-esp32-board-in-arduino-ide-windows-instructions/):
`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/gh-pages/package_esp32_dev_index.json`
When installing the board, go for the versin `2.0.2`
3. Install the ESP32Cam library following this [link](https://github.com/yoursunny/esp32cam) and their README
4. Clone this repository 
5. Open the file `/ESP32/ESP32Cam_SimpleStream_SDCard_wakeup_final/ESP32Cam_SimpleStream_SDCard_wakeup_final.ino`.
6. *Compiling*: Under `Tools`select your board (`DEV Module`), `port` and enable the `PSRAM` enable 4MB external PSRAM.
7. Compile and Upload 

#### Upload files to SPIFFs

For the `HTML` and `CSS` files, you can upload the files to
