# Matchboxscope

This is a repository for the smallest standalone low-cost open-source DIY incubator-contained microscope that can be used for a gazzilion different applications. Sounds interesting? Continue reading!

The core component of this device is a ESP32 microcontroller that is packed with a small Camera (OV2460) and microSD card slot, which makes it a perfect match for your microscopy project. In the most minimal version, you don't anything but the ESP32-CAM and perhaps some chewing gum to raise the objective lens in order to create a finite corrected microscsope.

However, we wanted to make the microscope a bit more practical and created some 3D printed parts that will realize the following devices:

**The Anglerfish**: This device is well preserved in your beloved jars and hence watertight. Why? Throw it in your nearby pond and collect data how microfilm grows on the jars' surface. Fun! Follow the [**BLUE PILL ðŸ”µ**](Anglerfish.md)

**The Matchboxscope**: This is a simple self-contained microscope e.g. for tacking snapshots of your microfluidic chips, your parasite containing slides or just for fun. It comes with a minimum number of parts, but offers a spring-loaded z-stage. Also idea for your incubator-contained microscopy experiments! Follow the [**RED PILL ðŸ”´**](Matchboxscope.md)

**The Z-Stacker**: It adds an automatic focussing unit to the *Matchboxscope* in order to create temporal Z-stacks of your beloved cell cultures. It needs more electronics, but still relies on the ESP32-CAM only. Lots of fun, too.  Follow the [**GREEN PILL ðŸŸ¢**](Matchboxscope.md)

# Software

## Anglerfish Code

Getting many images in an autonomous "diving" experiment is key. For this, we wrote a firmware that enables you to find the focus and as soon as you'Re done, the microcontroller goes into deep-sleep mode to save energy. The following steps are important to carry out before your experiment.

**The protocol**
1. Assemble unit and charge battery
2. Upload software and insert SD card
3. Then connect the battery to ESP32 and watch the camera stream via wifi and adjust the focus so that you can see the surface (of the jar) in focus. That's what the screws and springs are for. You do this once.
4. Either with a switch (awkward, because you have to solder), or via Wifi (switch in Webgui/HTTP endpoint), deactivate the focus mode.
5. Microscope goes into deep-sleep mode and wakes up every `X` minutes to take a photo and save it on the SD card.

In deep-sleep setting it consumes virtually no power.


**Problem/thoughts:**
- It is not possible to detect whether it is deep-sleep or disconnected from the power supply, so we built in this funny construct with the date/time of flashing the ESP32. So you can reset the EEPROM variable for focus mode (yes/no) when you (re-)flash the microcontroller
- the SD card and the LED flash hinder each other a bit because they both run on the same pins (yup). But I think we managed to get everything working by relying on the 1-bit mode of the SD card (slower, but more stable); also important: Initialize the SD card before any GPIO assignment (i.e. in `setup()`)
- The same code could also be used in an incubator-contained micoroscope, for example, to observe the growth of cells. But for this it would be important to keep the Wifi stream running :)
